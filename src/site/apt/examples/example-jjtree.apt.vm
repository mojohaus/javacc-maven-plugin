JJTree Examples

  If you want to use JavaCC in combination with JJTree, simply copy the following snippet into your POM and adjust the
  goal configuration where the default values do not fit your needs. A list of all configuration options can be seen on
  the <<<{{{../jjtree-javacc-mojo.html}jjtree-javacc}}>>> goal page.

-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.javacc.plugin</groupId>
        <artifactId>javacc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>jjtree-javacc</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>jjtree-javacc</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <!-- options for JJTree and JavaCC go here -->
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  If you know older versions of the plugin you might be glad to notice that you no longer need to setup two executions
  to have JJTree and JavaCC run in a pipeline. The <<<jjtree-javacc>>> goal automatically runs both tools.
  
  Once the plugin is properly configured, you can generate the parser along with the tree nodes files by executing the
  <<<generate-sources>>> lifecycle phase:

+-----+
mvn generate-sources
+-----+

  Alternatively, you can invoke the <<<jjtree-javacc>>> goal directly from the command line, i.e. without having any other
  goals run that might be bound to lifecycle phases of your build:

+-----+
mvn javacc:jjtree-javacc
+-----+

  <<Note:>> If you want to use the later call you need to put the <<<\<configuration\>>>> element directly into the
  <<<\<plugin\>>>> element. That is because the configuration inside the <<<\<execution\>>>> element only applies if
  the goal is run as part of a lifecycle phase.
